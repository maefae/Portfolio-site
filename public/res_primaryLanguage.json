      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ My name is Megan Faith Seibert-Hughes and I am a student at Code Fellows. Before transitioning to a career in tech, I worked as a Psychological Operations Specialist for the U.S. Army Reserves, a Medical Courier, and had a pet sitting business. Outside of these jobs, I have a passion for creative work such as music production, web/graphic/UX design, and freelance work. Seeing the similarity in creative problem solving with front-end programming, I decided to learn Full-Stack Javascript. An ideal environment to use this skill would be working remotely with a group of like-minded individuals who are open, passionate, and approachable.",
