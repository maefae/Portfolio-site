      "description": "👋 My name is Megan Faith Seibert-Hughes and software developer who graduated from Code Fellows in 2023. Before transitioning to a career in tech, I worked as a Psychological Operations Specialist for the U.S. Army Reserves, a Medical Courier, and had a pet sitting business. I have a passion for creative work such as music production, web development, graphic design, and UX/UI design. Seeing the similarity in creative problem solving with front-end programming, I decided to learn Full-Stack Javascript. An ideal environment to use this skill would be working remotely with a group of like-minded individuals who are open, passionate, and approachable.",
